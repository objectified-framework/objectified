# Introduction

What is Objectified?

Objectified is a Schemas-as-a-Service platform that offers a time-series
JSON Database store with dynamic schemas, offering extended API support.

## Schemas-as-a-service

Schemas-as-a-service is a concept that allows an individual or
organization to store their schema definitions on an external service.

This means, you can define the schema objects that you often use, and
make changes as necessary, before publishing them.

Once you are satisfied with the definitions and are ready to deploy them
for use, you can simply publish the definitions, and you can use them
in your applications.  You can also publish them in a centralized
location, allowing others to consume your API definitions.

## Time-series JSON Database

The time-series storage functionality allows you to create instances of
data that can handle standard CRUD operations over a REST service.

Time-series data never deletes: records are added to existing instances,
but are never deleted - they are simply deactivated.

As a result, you have safe, auditable, traceable data that can be recalled
at any time with a simple time-based query.
